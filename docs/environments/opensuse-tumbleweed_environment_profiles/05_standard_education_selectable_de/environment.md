# openSUSE Tumbleweed Standard Education Setup with Selectable DE

## Purpose

Education workstation profile for students, teachers, classroom labs, STEM, office work, and age/grade package expansion.

## Default Installation Mode

Desktop install. MATE, XFCE, KDE, or GNOME are practical classroom choices.

# Common openSUSE Tumbleweed Rules

- Target OS: openSUSE Tumbleweed.
- Package manager: `zypper`.
- Default install should remain headless unless this profile says desktop is required.
- Optional desktop environments are selectable and should not be installed together unless explicitly requested.
- Use official distribution repository packages first.
- Enable third-party repositories only when needed for firmware, codecs, Steam, NVIDIA/proprietary GPU drivers, or vendor tooling.
- Validate package availability before building automation:
```bash
zypper info <package>
zypper search <term>
```
- Recommended install command style:
```bash
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install <packages>
```
- Avoid installing every package in the archive. “Practical maximum” means a broad usable profile, not the full repository.

```

## Exclusions / Guardrails

```text
Do not install multiple desktop environments unless explicitly requested.
Do not install GPU vendor drivers unless hardware or user selection requires it.
Do not enable server daemons on desktop profiles unless explicitly requested.
Use --no-install-recommends or distro equivalent for lean/headless profiles where appropriate.
Validate renamed, removed, EOL, or architecture-specific packages before automation.
```

## Example Install Pattern

```bash
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install <packages>
```

## LLM Build Notes

- Treat this file as a planning profile, not a guaranteed resolved dependency lockfile.
- Resolve package names against the selected distro release and CPU architecture.
- For Raspberry Pi, ARM, or older/EOL releases, expect some desktop, gaming, container, or GPU packages to differ or be unavailable.
- Services are populated by installed packages; enable only the services needed for the selected role.

# Debian 13 Trixie Standard Desktop Setup with Selectable DE

## Purpose

Balanced daily-driver desktop for browsing, office work, media, printing, scanning, remote access, and general productivity.

## Default Installation Mode

Desktop install. User selects exactly one DE.

# Common Debian 13 Trixie Rules

- Target OS: Debian 13 Trixie.
- Package manager: `apt`.
- Default install should remain headless unless this profile says desktop is required.
- Optional desktop environments are selectable and should not be installed together unless explicitly requested.
- Use official distribution repository packages first.
- Enable third-party repositories only when needed for firmware, codecs, Steam, NVIDIA/proprietary GPU drivers, or vendor tooling.
- Validate package availability before building automation:
```bash
apt-cache policy <package>
apt-cache depends <package>
apt-cache search <term>
```
- Recommended install command style:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <packages>
```
- Avoid installing every package in the archive. â€œPractical maximumâ€ means a broad usable profile, not the full repository.

- XFCE: `task-xfce-desktop` / `xubuntu-desktop`
- Cinnamon: `task-cinnamon-desktop` / `ubuntucinnamon-desktop`
- MATE: `task-mate-desktop` / `ubuntu-mate-desktop`
- LXQt/Lubuntu: `task-lxqt-desktop` / `lubuntu-desktop`
- LXDE: `task-lxde-desktop` where available

## Services / Daemons Expected

```text
ssh
networking service
firewall service
logging/cron
selected application services as installed
```

## Exclusions / Guardrails

```text
Do not install multiple desktop environments unless explicitly requested.
Do not install GPU vendor drivers unless hardware or user selection requires it.
Do not enable server daemons on desktop profiles unless explicitly requested.
Use --no-install-recommends or distro equivalent for lean/headless profiles where appropriate.
Validate renamed, removed, EOL, or architecture-specific packages before automation.
```

## Example Install Pattern

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <packages>
```

## LLM Build Notes

- Treat this file as a planning profile, not a guaranteed resolved dependency lockfile.
- Resolve package names against the selected distro release and CPU architecture.
- For Raspberry Pi, ARM, or older/EOL releases, expect some desktop, gaming, container, or GPU packages to differ or be unavailable.
- Services are populated by installed packages; enable only the services needed for the selected role.
